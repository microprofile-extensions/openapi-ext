# Example Application

This is a very basic example application to demonstrate the OpenApi extensions.

## Running the example.

Using maven, you can start this application using Payara or OpenLiberty:

```
    mvn -Ppayara clean install
```
or
```
    mvn -Popenliberty clean install
```

You can then go to http://localhost:8080/openapi-example/api/openapi-ui/
